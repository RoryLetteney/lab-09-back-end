# Project Name

**Author**: Rory Letteney
**Version**: 1.0.6

## Overview
This application takes in user input in the form of a city name, and returns the weather for said location.

## Getting Started
To use this app:
> npm install

## Architecture
We are using JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, and CORS. Using NodeJS we send a request to the Dark Sky API and Google Maps API to retrieve the weather data for a user's query.

## Change Log
04-23-2019 1:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET routes for the location resource and weather resource. Also handles status 500 errors.

04-24-2019 1:59pm - Application now has fully-functional calls to the Google Maps and Dark Sky APIs. Returns valid data dependant upon user input.

04-26-2019 1:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional call to the TMDb API. Returns valid data dependant upon user input.
